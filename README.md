# CssOff 2012

My submission to the 2012's worldwide CSS off competition by [UnmatchedStyle](http://unmatchedstyle.com/) - achieved the [3rd place](http://unmatchedstyle.com/news/cssoff-winners-2012.php)

## What's this?

CSSOff is a competition for front-end developers to show off their skills in a no holds barred display of CSS and markup skills.

In the early 2012 edition, I landed 3rd out of 400+ world competitors!

Each entry was marked by 10 industry-renowned judges (including Chris Coyier and Ethan Marcotte). Marking criteria included code cleanliness, validation, interactions, project size, good choice points, browser support & design.
